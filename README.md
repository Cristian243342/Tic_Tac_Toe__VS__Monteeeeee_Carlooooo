# XOR 0 -- A simple Tic Tac Toe game, written in C~

## Notice

On the first assignment regarding to our Chess project, we had [the following link](https://github.com/EugenM03/simple--ai--chess) to access the source code and the initial implementation.

Unfortunately, the continuation of the project was not possible, due to limited time and homeworks/assignments to other classes. Thus, we have decided to create another simple game (with AI, duh!) to still create a project correspondent to PCLP3 task. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.

The new link is [here](https://github.com/Cristian243342/Tic_Tac_Toe__VS__Monteeeeee_Carlooooo).

## Introduction

**XOR 0** is a command-line based game written in C *(and 2% Makefile)* that implements the classic Tic Tac Toe (Noughts & Crosses) game. It is a simple yet fun game that you, *the user*, are playing against the opponent.

The game features a simple 3x3 board, with places that can be taken accordingly with X or O, according to the standard rules. The environment where the "drawing fight" is happening, *sadly enough*, is the console interface you are currently running the game. The application also features an AI which its "intelligence" is proportional to the difficulty choosed before starting the game.

## Usage

To start the program, firstly use the command `make` (or any equivalent command for compiling the source code). Upon opening the executable, you can choose what side do you want to play (either `X` or `O`) and what difficulty level you are comfortable with: 1 for easy (*requires little attention*), 2 for medium (*average person*) or hard (*don't expect perfect moves though*).

After each move, a representation of the 3x3 board will be sent to ```STDOUT```. The program is done once we have a winner or if it's a draw.

## Implementation
When searching
for the best move in a given position, it's
important to use an efficient search algorithm that can explore the game tree
as quickly as possible.
